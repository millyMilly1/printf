Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/milltMilly1/printf.git


Include the printf.h header file in your C code:


#include "printf.h"
Use the my_printf function in your code to print formatted output, just like you would with the standard printf:


int main() {
    my_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    my_printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);
    return 0;
}

Compile your code along with the printf.c file:
gcc -o my_program my_program.c printf.c


Run your program:
./my_program


Installation
No installation is required for this project. Simply clone the repository and include the printf.h header file in your C code to use the my_printf function.
